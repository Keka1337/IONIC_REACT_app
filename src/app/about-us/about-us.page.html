  <p>
    Salsa dance is almost a century old and it originated on the island of Cuba.
    The dance and music styles of salsa developed simultaneously along with
    other musical styles, such as mambo, flamenco, and tango in the1920s. The
    island of Cuba was the melting pot for these Latin dance forms at that time.
    The name ‘Salsa’ was coined by a Cuban studio, Fania, recognising the
    potential of the dance form. The name was spread around through word of
    mouth and radio. Then it started its journey to other parts of the world,
    starting with Miami and some parts of South America.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though it has Cuban origin, its first traces can be found in our history
    that dates back further. The basic elements that makes the dance form what
    it is were brought together by immigrants who came to settle down in or were
    brought to Latin America. The land offered these immigrants a great chance
    to build a better life. It was during the final years of the nineteenth
    century that the first glimpses of Salsa, though it wasn’t given this name
    until then, were seen. It has now become a worldwide phenomenon that not
    just thrills professional competitors and club dancers. It has millions of
    fans around the world, and many who join salsa dance classes to twist with
    “Cuban motion”.
